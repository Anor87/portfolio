                        Project 1 explores how to make the HKUST campus more animal-friendly for visiting animal students. 
                        Our goal is to identify a target group of animals, understand their unique needs, and analyze the obstacles 
                        they would face when navigating and learning on campus.<br/>
                        <br/>
                        To approach this problem, we considered an extreme scenario—imagining what it would be like for an animal with significant physical and sensory limitations to study at HKUST. 
                        We put ourselves in their paws by simulating challenges such as limited mobility and impaired vision. The following details our learning process and reflections.

                    <p>
                        To narrow our focus, our group chose to study what would happen if a sloth were a visiting student at HKUST. Sloths are fundamentally different from humans in various ways: they move extremely slowly (about 200 meters per hour), have poor vision in daylight, and possess limited hearing abilities. 
                        These characteristics make them an interesting case for accessibility challenges.<br />
                        <br/>
                        We began by researching sloths through multiple sources, including articles, online videos, and AI-generated insights from ChatGPT. The AI helped us summarize sloth behaviors and possible obstacles if a sloth were a visiting student. Meanwhile videos provided real-world observations of their movement patterns and interactions with their environment. After gathering information, we conducted a brainstorming session where each team member contributed potential obstacles sloths might face. 
                        Using a mind map, we categorized these challenges into five key areas:

                    <br/>
                    <p class="bullet-pt">
                        •	Campus Navigation: Difficulty reading signs, moving between buildings, and using stairs<br />
                        •	Digital Interfaces: Inability to interact with touchscreens and keyboards<br />
                        •	Learning Experience: Struggles with traditional classroom setups and lecture formats<br />
                        •	Food & Resting Areas:  Need for designated slow-movement zones and adapted seating/rest spaces<br />
                        •	Social Integration:  Difficulty engaging in group activities due to their slow responses<br />
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Before our brainstorming session, I researched and suggested potential animal candidates, including capybaras and sloths. After selecting the sloth, I compiled key facts about its lifestyle and shared a video about sloths’ survival strategies, 
                        which helped our team understand the practical implications of their slow movement. I also found a video showing people assisting a stranded sloth on a road, which inspired us to consider campus navigation as a primary challenge.<br/>
                        <br/>
                        During the brainstorming session, I was responsible for analyzing sloths’ needs and obstacles. I categorized them into five groups (navigation, digital interfaces, learning, food/rest, and social integration) to structure our discussion. 
                        This classification helped us systematically identify accessibility gaps in the campus environment. 
                        Later, I presented our team’s mind map to the class, summarizing our key findings and proposed considerations.

                    <br/>
                    <div class="img-box">

                    <p>
                        One of the most valuable lessons from this project was the importance of understanding user needs before designing solutions. 
                        Instead of jumping to conclusions, we first studied how sloths live and interact with their environment. 
                        This approach allowed us to immerse ourselves in their perspective and identify real challenges they would face at HKUST. 
                        Moving forward, I plan to apply this user-centered approach to future projects, potentially conducting interviews to gather firsthand insights.<br/>
                        <br/>
                        Another key takeaway was the power of mind mapping in brainstorming. 
                        Initially, I hesitated to share some ideas, fearing they might be unrealistic. 
                        However, the mind map method encouraged open-ended ideation without immediate judgment. 
                        By visualizing and connecting ideas like puzzle pieces, we built upon each other's thoughts, fostering a more dynamic and creative problem-solving process.<br/>
                        <br/>
                        Lastly, this project made me reflect on real-world accessibility challenges beyond the sloth scenario. 
                        For instance, visually impaired students at HKUST may struggle due to the lack of tactile guiding paths in corridors and staircases. 
                        Although they represent a small percentage of students, inclusivity matters, and our campus could improve its accessibility for all users. 
                        This insight has inspired me to consider accessibility solutions in future design projects.
